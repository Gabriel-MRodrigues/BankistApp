# BankistApp
Bankist app is an application built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript that simulates an user interface of a bank where users can check their transactions.

## Focus
- Array manipulation
- Dates
- Numbers

## Features
- Quick user validation
- Closing account
- Transferring money between accounts
- Requesting loan
- Account summary
- Sort by transaction amount

# How to use it
The current version of the application includes two users: Jessica Davis and Jonas Schmedtmann. To log in, you can use their usernames and passwords:

- js / 1111 for Jonas
- jd / 2222 for Jessica

Since there are only two accounts, money transfers are limited to transactions between these two users.

# References
I built this application by following along with Jonas Schmedtmannâ€™s course. While I wrote the code myself, I used the classes as a guide to ensure I was on the right track. I also added some features on my own (such as user validation and improving user experience) because they made sense to me and improved the overall functionality.
